# Movies-ETL Overview
The purpose of this repository is to extract, transform, and load a set of three .csvs into an sql database to produce a database of movie information and ratings.
This assignment is unfinished, but I'm submitting anyways- I have five other assignments to turn in to be back on pace.
I will revisit this assignment and resubmit when I'm less crunched for time.
